It is important to note that CAMPS is actively under development and new features are added frequently.  
The user is advised to check the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/NOAA-MDL/CAMPS>`_ and these 
documentation pages frequently for software and documentation updates.

CAMPS can be utilized in one of two ways; through an interactive python environment, or by running each driver script in succession.  
The latter is referred to as a “CAMPS forecast development” (for those familiar with MOS, this is similar in nature to a MOS “development”).  

First, regardless of your use case, ensure CAMPS and the necessary dependencies are properly installed on your machine.
