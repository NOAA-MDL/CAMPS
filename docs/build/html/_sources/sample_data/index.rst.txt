Sample Wisps-encoded data files
===============================

The concepts presented in the application profile and other documents are quite abstract.
In these sections we present sample files for download alongside explanations of their metadata.
If you are reading this document as a standalone PDF, then please refer to a web presentation of the WISPS documentation.

Here are brief descriptions of the data contained in each sample file:
 - Model Output contains gridded data from the NWS spectral Global Forecast System (GFS).  The values were read from a latitude-longitude grid, and projected to a Lambert Conformal grid.
 - Surface Observations contains surface observations for a number of airport locations in and around the US.  They were originally encoded in the METAR code form.
 - Marine Observations contains maritime data buoy observations from the Great Lakes and coastal waters of the US.  
 - Mesonet Observations contains surface observations from a wide variety of mesonet networks in and around the US.
