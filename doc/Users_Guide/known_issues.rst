Graphing
=========

The graphing functionality within the GUI section of the code base is currently broken.  
Naming schemes within CAMPS have been under active development, which has caused this functionality to become slightly out of date.  
Efforts are underway to update this feature so that it can be available for use again soon.

NWS Codes Registry
=====================

CAMPS is currently making use of NetCDF Linked-Data to reference the NWS codes-registry web resource.  
The codes-registry is also under active development.  The look, purpose, and content of the NWS codes-registry will change as CAMPS matures as a software package.
