The following sections detail the use of various necessary components required
for a Netcdf-CAMPS data file. Requirements, best practices, and justifications
are given for a netCDF-CAMPS data file. Extra care is given in explaining some
of the more complicated aspects, such as; time coordinates, event probabilities,
and percentiles.
