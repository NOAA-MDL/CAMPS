Technical Description
=======================

Network Common Data Format (NetCDF) will be used as the primary CAMPS file format, as it supports the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. 
In addition, NetCDF also offers a self-describing data format with more flexibility than other widely used table driven formats such as TDLPACK or Gridded Binary (GRIB). 
Additionally, NetCDF has more widespread support within the StatPP community than other self-describing data formats like Hierarchical Data Format (HDF).
