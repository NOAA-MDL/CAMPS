1.  General principles
======================

We have used the Observations and Measurements (O&M) model as a guideline when encoding data files.
We focus more on the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) as a model for encoding StatPP parameters.
The various values stored in the parameter file are *entities* (parameters and other ancillary data) that were generated by some *activity* (e.g. the Development Phase), and that *activity* was performed by some *agent* (the responsible organization).

In most cases a StatPP Parameter File will contain one or more lists of weather elements and other data that will be used as inputs.
It will also contain one or more lists of forecasts that are generated as outputs.
Finally, it will contain one or more arrays of parameter values that can use a set of inputs to create a set of outputs.
