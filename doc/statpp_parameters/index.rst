Encoding parameter files in CAMPS
=================================

StatPP techniques that include a distinct Training Phase often yield a set of parameters (StatPP Parameters) that are used to carry information into the Production Phase.
(See section :ref:`overview-2` of the Overview for a more complete explanation of these terms.)
Of course, these StatPP Parameters must be encoded in one or more parameter files.
Again, CAMPS uses netCDF-CF and other widely-recognized standards to guide this encoding.
